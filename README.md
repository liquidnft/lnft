# JungleLab - Liquid Bitcoin Digital Assets Publishing Platform

LNFT is a web-based platform for issuing and transacting with non-fungible tokens on the [Bitcoin Liquid Network](https://blockstream.com/liquid/). Blockstream is sponsoring its development and hosting an exemplary curated instance of it for use by Bitcoin artists at [Raretoshi](https://raretoshi.com) 

The plan is to separate out any Raretoshi-specific features from the core platform functionality so that anyone can adapt the platform to host their own Liquid-based NFT site but that's currently a work in progress

## Features

 - User accounts and profiles for artists and collectors include custom avatars, contact info and biography
 - Users can follow other artists and collectors and like/favorite individual artworks
 - Artists can upload digital media files (jpg, png, gif, mp4) representing an artwork and add metadata like a title, description, and tags
 - Selected metadata is published in the [liquid asset registry](https://docs.blockstream.com/liquid/developer-guide/proof-of-issuance.html) so that tokens can be recognized by external wallets
 - Media files are added to the IPFS network upon being uploaded and are given a unique content identifier (CID) derived from the SHA256 hash of the file
 - The CID is embedded in the Liquid token issuance transaction contract, permanently and provably linking the file to the token
 - Artworks are listed in a searchable/sortable/filterable marketplace gallery
 - Artists can list an artwork for sale by setting an optional listing price, royalty rate, and/or auction period
 - Bids and sales are conducted peer-to-peer using atomic swaps so the platform host does not need to escrow funds
 - Listings, bids, transfers and new artwork activity are logged and presented in a site-wide feed
 - A web-based liquid wallet is integrated into the user's profile page and allows them to fund their accounts with L-BTC or any kind of liquid asset
 - Wallets can be backed up and imported using a 12-word BIP mnemonic seed phrase
 - Built-in integration with the [coinos.io](https://coinos.io) API allows users to instantly convert BTC to L-BTC by depositing to an on-chain address or paying a lightning network invoice
 - Royalties and auction holding periods are enforced through a 2-of-2 signing server that only signs off on transactions that meet certain conditions
