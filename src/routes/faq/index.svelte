        <h3>What's an NFT?</h3>

        <p>
          An NFT is a non-fungible token, a kind of digital bearer asset that
          represents ownership of a unique item or property. NFT's are designed
          to be distinguishable from each other so that no two tokens are the
          same, making them ideal for representing collectibles.
        </p>

        <h3>How do I use them?</h3>

        <p>
          NFT’s can be issued on different blockchains and networks. On JungleLab,
          they're created on the Liquid network and can be stored in any wallet that
          supports Liquid assets. JungleLab offers a free built-in web wallet that
          gets used by default.
        </p>

        <h3>How are they created?</h3>

        <p>
          When an artist first uploads an image or video file for an artwork, the
          file is added to the IPFS network and assigned a hash number that uniquely
          identifies the contents of the file. The artist's JungleLab wallet will
          then generate a Liquid asset issuance transaction containing the title of
          the artwork and its hash and broadcast it to be permanently recorded in
          the Liquid blockchain.
        </p>

        <h3>Who can publish their music, video, art or digital asset here?</h3>

        <p>
          Anyone can apply to become an artist on our platform. Your application
          will be reviewed by our team and we'll reach out to let you know if
          you’ve been accepted.
        </p>

        <h3>What’s different about JungleLab compared to other NFT platforms?</h3>

        <p>
          JungleLab is a NFT platform that uses the Bitcoin Liquid Network
          instead of Ethereum or Counterparty. The Liquid network is a bitcoin
          sidechain where transaction fees are denominated in L-BTC, Liquid Bitcoin,
          which is pegged 1:1 to bitcoin.
        </p>

        <p>
          Transaction fees on Liquid are orders of magnitude cheaper than on the
          bitcoin or ethereum networks. Liquid also supports native asset
          issuance and atomic swaps which make it possible for people who don't
          know or trust each other to exchange their different tokens and assets
          directly in a single transaction without needing to go through a
          trusted 3rd party escrow agent.
        </p>

        <h3>How do I get some L-BTC?</h3>
