          so that you may decide whether or not to provide information to us. By

          This Privacy Policy applies to all information (including personal
          information) collected through our sites.

          “<b>Personal information</b>” means information that identifies you

        <h3>2. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</h3>

        <h4>Active Collection of Information</h4>

        <p>
          We may collect certain information that you voluntarily provide to us
          which may contain personal information. For example, when you create
          your user account we may collect your username and email address. We
          retain this information until you ask to be removed from the Website.
          The User may choose to provide their full name, location, biographical
          information, and include links to their website or other social
          platforms. For users submitting an application to become Artists in
          the Website we may collect information such as name, email address,
          artwork samples, information about your promoting sites (website or
          other social platforms) and other information about your art. In
          addition, if any Token has a physical item associated, we may collect
          shipping information (such as name and mailing address) from you in
          order to ship the items to you. We do not sell or otherwise transmit
          any such actively-collected personal information to third parties
          other than to third party service providers discussed in Section 4.
        </p>

        <h4>Passive Collection of Information</h4>

        <p>
          When you visit our sites, some information about your visit is
          automatically collected. This information includes your IP address,
          access times, browser type and language, and referring web site
          addresses. We collect this information to troubleshoot technical
          issues, understand how visitors use our website, provide an experience
          relevant to the general location associated with your IP address, and
          to make improvements to our website. If you arrive at our website by
          clicking a link, then we may capture information that tracks your
          visit from that link.
        </p>

        <p>
          We may place a cookie on your hard drive during the web visit to help
          us identify the number of unique visitors to our website, whether or
          not those visitors are repeat visitors, and the source of the visits.
          If you do not want this information to be collected, you may disable
          cookies in your web browser.
        </p>

        <p>
          Additionally, we may use third-party analytics services to collect and
          analyze data automatically collected from site users; the type and
          nature of those services may change without notice. Data collected
          this way is governed by the terms and conditions of those third party
          services.
        </p>

        <h4>Links to non-NFT Glee Websites</h4>

        <p>
          Some projects, tools, forums, or other publicly-available resources
          associated with NFT Glee may be hosted on third-party websites.
          Additionally, we may provide links to third-party websites for
          informational purposes. The privacy practices of those sites may
          differ from our practices, are not controlled by NFT Glee, and are
          not covered by this Privacy Policy. We do not make any representations
          about third-party websites. We encourage you to review their privacy
          policies before submitting your personal data to such sites.

          Information to NFT Glee and we learn that the Personal Information is
          the information of a child under 13, we will attempt to delete the
          information as soon as possible. If you believe that we might have any
          Personal Data from a child under 13, please contact us at
