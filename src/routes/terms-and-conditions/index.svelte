          carefully. This Agreement is between you (the “User(s),” “Artist(s),”
          “Fan(s)”, and collectively any entity using the Site - “Users”) and
          GreenAddressIT Limited (“Operator”, “we”or “us”), a company registered
          and incorporated under the laws of Malta with company number C62738

        </p>

        <p>
          THESE TERMS SET FORTH THE LEGALLY BINDING TERMS AND CONDITIONS THAT
          GOVERN YOUR USE OF THE WEBSITE OR PLATFORM. BY ACCESSING OR USING THIS
          SITE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND YOU HAVE
          THE RIGHT, AUTHORITY, AND CAPACITY TO ENTER INTO THESE TERMS. IF YOU
          DO NOT AGREE WITH ALL OF THE PROVISIONS OF THESE TERMS, YOU ARE
          PROHIBITED FROM ACCESSING, USING, OR TRANSACTING ON THE WEBSITE. YOU
          CONFIRM THAT YOU ARE LEGALLY PERMITTED TO USE THE SERVICES IN YOUR
          JURISDICTION AND THAT THE COMPANY IS NOT LIABLE FOR YOUR COMPLIANCE
          WITH SUCH APPLICABLE LAWS. IN ADDITION, BY PARTICIPATING IN ANY
          AUCTION YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THAT AUCTION.
        </p>

        <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>

        Our
        <a href="/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy can be found here</a>
        and it describes the ways we collect, use, store and disclose your
        personal information. You agree to the collection, use, storage, and
        disclosure of your data in accordance with our Privacy Policy.

        <h3>The Website</h3>

        <p>
          { branding.projectName } is an open source curated instance of the LNFT platform for
          Bitcoin artists and fans. LNFT is a web-based platform for issuing and
          transacting with non-fungible tokens on the Bitcoin Liquid Network.
        </p>

        <h3>Accessing and Interacting with the Website</h3>
        <h4>User account registration and types of accounts</h4>
        <p>
          All new users will need a valid email address to register in the
          Website. The Website has two types of user accounts: Artist and Fan
          account. All new users will automatically receive a Fan account when
          registering in the Website. This account will allow the User to trade
          NFTs in the Website but it will not provide permission to upload
          Artwork to the Website or mint NFTs. On the other hand, the Artist
          account will have the same functionality as the Fan account with the
          added permissions of uploading Artwork and minting NFTs in the
          Website. Initially, only a limited number of Artist accounts will be
          granted to selected artists. Users must ensure that Account(s)
          registered are personal and will not be used by any other person. You
          must inform us immediately of any breach of security, loss, theft or
          unauthorized use of your username, password or security information at
          <a href="mailto:support@{ branding.projectName }.com">support@{ branding.projectName }.com</a>
        </p>

        <p>
          Users agree to use the Website only for purposes that are legal and in
          accordance with these Terms and any applicable laws or regulations.
          You may not, and may not allow any third party to:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Send, upload, distribute or disseminate any unlawful, defamatory,
            harassing, abusive, fraudulent, obscene, or otherwise objectionable
            content Undertake any unlawful activity which would violate, or
            assist in violation of, any law, statute, ordinance, or regulation,
            sanctions program administered in any relevant country.
          </li>
          <li>

            otherwise)
          </li>
          <li>
            Upload, post, transmit or otherwise make available through the
            Platform any content that infringes the intellectual proprietary
            rights of any party

          <li>
            Operate to defraud other Users, or any other person or provide
            false, inaccurate or misleading information
          </li>
          <li>
            Engage in, promote, or encourage illegal activity including but not
            limited to terrorism, tax evasion or money laundering.
          </li>
          <li>Exploit the Website for any unauthorized commercial purpose</li>
          <li>
            Remove any copyright, trademark or other proprietary rights notices
            contained in the Platform or any part of it
          </li>
          <li>
            Create user accounts by automated means or under false or fraudulent
            pretenses.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The Operator reserves the right to terminate, suspend or restrict
          Users access to any Account(s) if there is reasonable suspicion by us
          that the person logged into your Account(s) is not you or if we
          suspect that the Account(s) have been or will be used for any illegal,
          fraudulent, or unauthorized purposes in accordance with this Terms.
          Under no circumstances shall the Operator indemnified persons in
          accordance with these Terms, be responsible or liable for any direct
          or indirect losses, damages or costs suffered by you or any other
          person or entity due to any such termination, suspension or
          restriction of access to any Account(s).
        </p>

        <h3>Liquid Wallet</h3>

        <p>
          When registering a new account, the Website will automatically
          generate a free built-in non-custodial Liquid web-wallet that will be
          used by default in the Website. This is the recommended wallet to
          interact with the Website and it can be backed-up by recording the
          corresponding 12-words mnemonic seed phrase. Users however, have the
          option to import a different wallet by using their own 12-word
          mnemonic seed phrase.
        </p>

        <p>
          { branding.projectName } is a non-custodial service meaning that neither the Website
          nor Operator are ever in control of assets in Users wallets. Users are
          solely responsible for the security of their account and wallets. As
          with all crypto assets, control of the password, mnemonic seed phrase
          or private key is control of the asset. This is true for both NFTs and
          of the assets used to purchase them (e.g. L-BTC). Users also should
          realize that if the password, mnemonic seed phrase or private key is
          lost the assets will be permanently unrecoverable. In addition, since
          the wallet used to interact with the Website runs on the User’s device
          and in-browser, it is vulnerable to hacks and software bugs, in the
          operating system, and in other software (including malware) on that
          device and in the browser. You agree to maintain at all times adequate
          security and control of all of your account details, passwords, or any
          other codes that you use to access or interact with the Website. Users
          acknowledge and agree that the technologies used in { branding.projectName }
          (including but not limited to cryptocurrencies, web wallets, atomic
          swaps, NFTs, integrations with 3rd parties) are experimental,
          speculative, and inherently risky. Users acknowledge and agree that
          the { branding.projectName } services may be subject to bugs, malfunctions, timing
          errors, hacking and theft, that can adversely affect your account and
          may expose you to a risk of total loss, forfeiture of your funds or
          { branding.projectName } Items, or lost opportunities to buy or sell { branding.projectName } Items.
          { branding.projectName } and Operator assume no liability or responsibility for any
          such failures, risks, or uncertainties.
        </p>

        <h3>Transactions in the Website</h3>

        <p>
          Transactions in the Website are settled and recorded in the Liquid
          Network, (a Bitcoin federated sidechain) using Liquid assets such as
          Liquid bitcoin (L-BTC) or Liquid USD Tether (L-USDt). In order to mint
          or trade NFTs in the Website, Users have to fund their wallet with
          L-BTC. To reduce the friction between the Bitcoin and Liquid Networks
          and provide an easy onboarding experience, the Website has a built-in
          integration with a coin.os API that allows users to instantly convert
          BTC to L-BTC by depositing to an on-chain address or paying a
          lightning network invoice. While L-BTC is necessary to pay for
          transaction fees in the Website (including NFT minting), it is
          possible to fund your wallet with other supported Liquid assets such
          as L-USDt or Liquid CAD (L-CAD) to bid for NFTs denominated in that
          asset type.
        </p>

        <p>
          Transactions in { branding.projectName } are peer-to-peer and use atomic swaps. This
          means that neither the Website or Operator need to hold funds in
          escrow in Token sales. Partially Signed Elements Transactions (PSET)
          used in these atomic swaps ensure that the parties involved in a
          transaction follow the Sale terms. In addition, royalties and auction
          holding periods are enforced through a 2-of-2 signing server provided
          by the Website that only signs off on transactions that meet certain
          conditions including making sure that Artists receive their
          corresponding royalties. Initially { branding.projectName } will not charge any fee
          for any transaction performed in the Website (other than Liquid
          transaction fees), but this may change in the future.
        </p>

        <h3>Creation of { branding.projectName } Items</h3>

        <p>
          All Artwork (“Artwork(s)”, “Creation(s)”, “Work”) posted on the
          { branding.projectName } website is associated with a unique Liquid asset exclusively
          issued by an approved { branding.projectName } Artist. Each { branding.projectName } Item
          (“Item(s)”, “Non-fungible token(s)”, “NFT(s)” or “Token”) is minted by
          an Artist using the asset issuance functionality of the Liquid
          Network. The type of media files that are currently supported and can
          be used by Artists in { branding.projectName } to post their Work are jpg, png, gif
          and mp4. When an Artist first uploads his or her Work to { branding.projectName },
          the media file is added to the IPFS network and assigned a unique
          content identifier (CID) derived from the SHA256 hash of the file. The
          Website hosts an IPFS node that is capable of maintaining a copy and
          serving the media files to other nodes. Artists or anyone interested
          could run their own IPFS node to provide this service and add
          redundancy to the system. After adding the Artwork to the IPFS
          network, the Artist's wallet generates a Liquid asset issuance
          transaction containing some metadata including the title of the
          Artwork and the CID. This issuance transaction (“Mint”) is then
          broadcasted to be permanently recorded in the Liquid blockchain, added
          to the Blockstream Asset Registry and the minted Token is sent to the
          Artist’s wallet that can then be traded in the Website. This action
          provides { branding.projectName } Artists and Fans with a permanent record of
          authenticity and ownership of the Token. Since the asset registry is
          an open source project publicly available on GitHub anyone interested
          could clone this project and provide redundancy to the system. After a
          Token is minted by an Artist, he or she can then propose the terms
          (“Sale”) under which the Token will be sold to Fans (including the
          option to add royalties to be assigned to the original Artist) in a
          primary sale. After a { branding.projectName } Item is sold by the original Artist,
          it can then be traded in a secondary market provided by the Website to
          any { branding.projectName } User.
        </p>

        <h3>{ branding.projectName } Artists</h3>

        <p>
          Initially, only invited Artists will be able to post Artwork in the
          Website, mint Tokens and make a primary Sale of { branding.projectName } Items. This
          responsibility will then be passed on to the active { branding.projectName } Artists.
          Artists seeking an invitation to create and list works for sale on
          { branding.projectName } must submit a request that can be found here. Please keep in
          mind that due to current limited resources this process could
          initially extend for months. { branding.projectName } has unilateral discretion in
          curating in the Website and makes no guarantees or promises that any
          Artists will be approved, even if the Artist was invited by a member
          of { branding.projectName } to submit a request
        </p>

        <p>
          By posting their Work and offering a Token on a Sale, an Artist agrees
          with Operator, and represents and warranties to Operator and any Fan
          bidding on the Work that:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            The Artist has the legal right to post the Work and to offer the
            Token and grant the rights in the Work described in the Sale terms
          </li>
          <li>
            That the Work doesn’t violate any third party’s rights, including
            copyright or trademark rights or the moral rights of artists
          </li>
          <li>
            that the Work doesn’t violate any law, including blasphemy or
            decency laws, and can legally be displayed to anyone regardless of
            his or her age
          </li>
          <li>
            Any information provided by the Artist, whether about themselves or
            any Work, is true, correct and complete and they will update as
            needed
          </li>
          <li>
            They are not acting individually or in collusion with anyone,
            including any Fan or User, to manipulate the Sale
          </li>
          <li>
            The Artist assumes all risks of using the Website, issuing Tokens,
            conducting Sales and settling Sales
          </li>
          <li>
            The Artist grants to the Operator a perpetual, world-wide,
            royalty-free license to use the Work and any information provided
            about the Work in operating the Website or in promoting the Website
            or Operator’s business generally. The fact that Operator may inspect
            the Work at, prior to or after posting to the Website does not
            affect these agreements, representations and warranties
          </li>
          <li>
            Artist agrees to indemnify { branding.projectName } and Operator and be held liable
            for any claim against { branding.projectName } or Operator arising out of the
            Artist’s breach of these Terms. Artist releases and forever
            discharges { branding.projectName } and Operator from any damages or causes of
            action resulting from a sale of any of the Artist’s listed { branding.projectName }
            Items occurring after the Artist’s breach of these Terms.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          By posting their Work and offering a Token, an Artist acknowledges to
          Operator that:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            the Artist understands that technical errors, whether on the
            Artist’s part or in the Website software, the Liquid Network or any
            underlying cryptocurrency network are solely the risk of the Artist
          </li>
          <li>
            The Artist understands that Operator can refuse any Work or
            terminate any Sale at any time in its sole discretion for any reason
            or no reason at all without any liability to the Artist
          </li>
          <li>
            If Operator receives any DMCA notice or other claim of infringement
            of rights or of law, Operator may act as it sees fit in order to
            protect its interests, including removing the purportedly offending
            work from the Website, suspending or removing the Artist account and
            providing the claimant or law enforcement agency with any and all
            information about the Artist and the Work
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>{ branding.projectName } Fans</h3>

        <p>
          By bidding on an Token, a Fan agrees with Operator, and represents and
          warranties to Operator and the Artist or any other { branding.projectName } User
          that:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            They are old enough to access the site and to agree to buy the Token
            under applicable law
          </li>
          <li>
            They own and are entitled to use the assets they are using to buy
            the Token and such assets are not proceeds of any criminal activity
          </li>
          <li>
            Owning and displaying the Work does not violate applicable law
          </li>
          <li>
            They are not acting individually or in collusion with anyone,
            including the Artist, to manipulate the Sale
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>By bidding on a Token, a Fan acknowledges to the Operator that:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            The Fan understands that technical errors, whether on the Fan’s part
            or in the Website software, the Liquid Network or any underlying
            cryptocurrency network are solely the risk of the Fan
          </li>
          <li>
            Winning a Sale creates an agreement between the Artist and the Fan
          </li>
          <li>
            Purchasing a Token is a form of digital patronage and conveys only
            rights to that Item. The exclusive rights of the associated Artwork
            belong to the artist regardless of Token ownership. A Token does not
            convey any right or ownership on the associated Work and the Artwork
            can not be reproduced or derivative work created unless explicit
            permission is granted by the Artist or in the Sale terms. If any
            additional right is granted to the Token holder, this is
            automatically cancelled when the Token holder is no longer in
            possession of the associated Token for any reason including but not
            limited to selling of the Token.
          </li>
          <li>
            The ownership of the Token provides the Fan with the ability to
            display or perform the Work privately or publicly in social media
            platforms, blogs, digital galleries or virtual environments such as
            virtual worlds or virtual galleries for promotional purposes with
            the intent to sell the associated Token or to share the purchase or
            discuss the Artwork. Any other features associated with the Token
            including but not limited to a physical representation of the
            Artwork will be explicitly described in the { branding.projectName } Item Sale.
            Unless authorized by the Artist or Sale terms, the owner of a Token
            can not use the associated Artwork for commercial purposes including
            but not limited to selling copies of the Work. If any additional
            permissions or rights are granted, these would be automatically
            cancelled once the Token holder is no longer in possession of the
            associated Token for any reason including but not limited to selling
            of the Token.

            The Operator may act as it sees fit in order to protect its
            interests, including cancelling the Fan’s account and providing the
            Artists or law enforcement agency with any and all information about
            the Fan.

        <h3>{ branding.projectName } Marketplace</h3>

        <p>
          { branding.projectName } provides an easy and intuitive way for Artists and Fans to
          buy and sell { branding.projectName } Items. Artworks are listed in a
          searchable/sortable/filterable marketplace gallery. Bids and sales are
          conducted peer-to-peer using atomic swaps so the Website or Operator
          do not hold funds on escrow and are never in custody of User’s funds
          or { branding.projectName } Items. Listings, bids, transfers and new Artwork activity
          are logged and presented in a site-wide feed. Royalties and auction
          holding periods are enforced through a 2-of-2 signing method where one
          of the keys is controlled by the Website and only transactions that
          meet certain conditions (such as original artist receiving the
          corresponding royalties) are signed off. Once NFTs are in a 2-2 wallet
          they are locked in the Website to ensure Sale terms such as auction
          times and royalties conditions are fulfilled. The terms of a Sale,
          like purchase currency, bidding intervals, settlement and number of
          Tokens auctioned are specified on the Site for the Sale
        </p>

        <h4>
          There are several trading options available for Users that include:
        </h4>

        <p>Listing options:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Simple listing: Artists or Token owners can set a predefined price
            for the { branding.projectName } Item or not, and decide on the listing asset
            denomination (e.g. L-BTC, L-USDt, etc.). The option to define a
            royalty rate (in percentage) is also available only for Artists when
            originally listing a { branding.projectName } Item in a primary sale. This rate can
            not be modified afterwards by any Token owner. This listing option
            keeps the { branding.projectName } Item available for purchase/bid as long as the
            Sale terms are not fulfilled, delisted or deleted by the Artist or
            Token owner.
          </li>
          <li>
            Auctions: This type of listing provides the same options as simple
            listing but adds the possibility to the Artists or Token owners to
            set a start and end date where offers can be presented by other
            Users. Once the auction is completed, the Artist or Token owner can
            select an offer to complete the Sale.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Bidding options:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Make an offer: In this case a listing price is not predefined for
            the { branding.projectName } Item. This allows Users to make offers on a { branding.projectName }
            Item that the Artist or current owner of the { branding.projectName } Item can then
            accept, reject or wait until more offers are available.
          </li>
          <li>
            Buy Now: Artist or Token owners can decide to list a { branding.projectName } Item
            for a predefined price. This allows other Users to automatically buy
            the { branding.projectName } Item for the listed price. The completion of the trade
            is enforced by an atomic swap transaction created by the Artist or
            Token owner wallet when listing a { branding.projectName } Item. In this scenario
            however, it is also possible for Users to make an offer instead of
            buying the { branding.projectName } Item.
          </li>
        </ul>
